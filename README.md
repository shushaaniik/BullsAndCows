# BullsAndCows

Welcome to Bulls and Cows, a versatile code-breaking game implementation designed to provide a thrilling experience for players of all levels. Whether you prefer challenging the computer, testing your deduction skills, or simulating a teaching scenario, this project offers various modes to suit your gameplay preferences.

## Introduction
Bulls and Cows is a classic game where one player creates a secret code, and the other player attempts to crack it through a series of guesses. In this project, I have expanded upon the traditional rules to bring you a comprehensive Bulls and Cows experience.

## Modes

### Computer Guessing Mode
Are you up for the challenge? In Computer Guessing Mode, you get to create the secret code, and the computer will do its best to crack it. Test your skills as you try to stump the computer with your cunning code-making abilities. Can you create an unbreakable code?

### User Guessing Mode
In User Guessing Mode, the computer generates a secret code, and your challenge is to guess the code. Utilize your code-breaking skills and deductive reasoning to make guesses and crack the computer's hidden combination. Can you outwit the computer and successfully decipher the secret code it has created? Test your abilities and strive for victory in this exciting mode.

### Computer-User Guessing Mode
In Computer-User Guessing Mode, you and the computer engage in a head-to-head code-breaking battle. The computer selects a secret code, and your task is to make guesses and crack the code before the computer can decipher your secret combination. Strategize, make calculated moves, and use your code-breaking skills to outsmart the computer.

### Computer Teaching Simulation Mode
In the Computer Teaching Simulation Mode, you can observe the computer acting as a teacher to help you improve your code-breaking skills. The computer will guide you through the process, providing tips.

## Customizable Code Length
My implementation allows you to play with secret codes of any length between 1 and 9 digits. Whether you prefer a quick and straightforward challenge or a complex mind-bending puzzle, you can customize the code length to match your desired level of difficulty.
